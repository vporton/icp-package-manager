Remaining things to do:

- Managing package repositories.

- Deinstallation, upgrading.

- UI:
    - Showing installed packages.
    - Managing installation and deinstallation.
    - Showing half-installed packages, managing repair/removal of them.
    - Scanning package dependencies in the UI.

- A special DAO.

- Every package should have owner(s) to specify who is able to change it.

- `FIXME`/`TODO` in the sources.
